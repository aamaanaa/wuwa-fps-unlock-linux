# Wuwa fps unlock linux
Wuthering waves fps unlocker for linux. Unlocks 120 FPS on the steam version of the game.

# NOTE: i will need to test more and fix a small issue before i bring this out. This means there is no release yet. It will take me some time to fix bugs and make it release ready!

## Why? 
Yes, there is already a fps locker. See the link at the bottom of this README. But:

- not made for Linux
- Made in python (i have a distaste for python sorry)
- Not compiled as a [static binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_build), witch golang can do. Just one binary needed.
- Overdone in my opinion. A simple console app with some parameters is more then enough, no need for a gui. *keep it simple, stupid*

## Usage
- Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/aamaanaa/wuwa-fps-unlock-linux/releases)
- CD into your downloads dir: `cd ~/Downloads/`
- Make it executable: `chmod +x wuvafps.elf`
- And then run it: `./wuvafps.elf`
*todo optional arguments*

## Support
**ONLY** Liux support will be given. If you are using windows, [use this](https://github.com/WakuWakuPadoru/WuWa_Simple_FPSUnlocker)
